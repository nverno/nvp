* Topics
- optimizing startup time: has increased to nearly 2 sec. Better to have
  multiple autoload files or combined? Use package-quickstart? Monolithic
  libraries or keep current organization?
- optimizing mode-local variables
- profiling: current script won't work on compiled init
- git-hooks: reconfigure updated git packages
- autotools management: for external deps? probably overkill
- org tags
- optimize org loadding time: parts can be separated
- texi/info: formatting, tools for parsing/navigating tags
- convert docs to html
- analyzing defgenerics perfomance
- when to prefer defsubst over macro/defun - when is a function too big
- emacs source tagging
- determing include path of project, eg. emacs source
- tracing: following all calls, not just main traced function
- doc programs: doc-base/install-docs for browsing debian docs

* Packages to look into
- Jumps: ggtags / smart-jump / dumb-jump
- Search: counsel+ivy has interfaces to info/ag / ripgrep is fast, but no
  wgrep?? Helm also has a nice info-lookup interface.
- Toggle&Repeat: evil, smartrep - see below
- Porcelains/Buffers: transient
- Packages: straight, package-build, package-recipe-mode
- Lex/Parsing: tablist-filter using wisent for simple grammar
