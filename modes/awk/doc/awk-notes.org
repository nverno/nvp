#+TITLE: Awk

* Functions
- Arrays passed by reference
- Gawk allows indirect function calls with '@func()' where ~func~ is a string,
  like function pointers in c/c++. Can be passed to functions, etc.

** Peculiarities
- There can't be a leading space before function calls
- Function local parameters are indicated by extra whitespace in the function
parameters, eg.

#+BEGIN_SRC awk
function f(passed-param1, passed-param2,    local-var) { ... }
#+END_SRC

* Variables
- ~PROCINFO~ contains info about current process, ~PROCINFO["identifiers"]~ will
  list all the builtin functions/variables + user-defined
- ~FUNTAB~ is array of user defined functions
- ENVIRON contains current environment, but modification isn't passed to
  commands invoked with ~system~
