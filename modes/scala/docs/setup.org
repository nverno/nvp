* SBT
- from sbt console in project, command ~~run~ will cause project to re-run on
  every file save.

* Ensime
- [[http://ensime.github.io/build_tools/sbt/][sbt with ensime]]
- to create ~.ensime~ file in project folder:
  - start ~sbt~ and run command ~ensimeConfig~
- ensime-company changes yas bindings in such a way that messes up yas bindings
  in all modes. Comment out the lines related to local-binding in
  ~ensime-company-setup~ and everything should work as expected.
