;;; Commentary:

;; TODO:
;;   - somehow merge local variable completion with bash-completion
;;   - restrict local variable candidates to the current context + globals
;;   - fix narrowing
;;   - create docstrings from function headers
;;   - jump to sourced functions
;;   - don't leave sourced scripts sitting around in buffers
